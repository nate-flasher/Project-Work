## Academic Resources
*Academic assistance*: The Academic Enrichment Center provides individualized academic skills help (e.g. test preparation, note taking, planning, etc.).  Contact Dr. Scott Gaier, scgaier@taylor.edu.
 
*Tutoring*: Peer tutoring services provides free help to students in most content areas.  For further information contact Darci Nurkkala, drnurkkala@taylor.edu

*Students with special needs*: The Academic Enrichment Center provides a variety of services for students who have physical or other disabilities.  Contact Ken Taylor, kntaylor@taylor.edu. If you need accommodations due to a disability, please see me so that I can help accordingly.


# Assignments

## Readings
Students will often be quizzed over reading assignments before the same material has been covered in lecture.

Students are strongly encouraged to write notes in their lab notebook while reading. Notebooks may be used for some quizzes. 


## Labs

Lab assignments are evaluated on a 3-point scale (see Grading Rubric section) and graded quickly - for participation - not graded carefully for solution correctness. A score of 3/3 does not indicate that each solution was 100% correct. Students should take time to understand the activity during the lab session.

*Unless specified otherwise in the assignment description, collaboration on **lab assignments** is encouraged and sometimes required. However, students are expected to formulate and understand their own solutions.*


## Homework

Students will be assigned seven projects. Each project will take approximately two weeks to complete. Projects will include programming assignments, program analysis, and security-related application usage.

Many security vulnerabilities and attacks take place at the system level. Therefore, for this course, a working knowledge of C and/or C++ will be helpful (COS 121 is a prerequisite). Multiple homework assignments will require the use of the C programming language. Additionally, students will be required to analyze code snippets from other programming languages including Java, Python, and PHP.

Many homework assignments will come in the form of a two-week project. However, additional smaller homework assignments may be assigned.

*Unless specified otherwise in the assignment description, collaboration on **homework assignments** is not permitted.*


## Quizzes
Instead of few large exams, this course will have many quizzes. The final quiz will be given during the scheduled final exam time.

Students should expect to take quizzes regularly. Quizzes may take multiple forms: take-home, open-notes, single-question, etc. Quizzes will often emphasize the most recent reading, homework assignments, and activities. However, all quizzes are cumulative.

At the end of the semester, the student's lowest *two* quiz scores will be dropped from the course grade calculation.

# Course Policies

## Attendance 
Attendance is expected. Attendance is recorded indirectly when students participate in in-class activities and take quizzes. If a student is absent for an activity or quiz they will receive no credit. 

No distinction is made between types of absences (unexcused or excused). Therefore, students do not need to notify the instructor of absences. Accommodations for excused absences are built into the quiz grading policy.

Students may appeal to the instructor for special consideration if they feel that this attendance policy has unfairly impacted their grade due to extenuating circumstances.


## Academic Policies and Regulations
Students must understand and adhere to all of Taylor University's *Academic Policies and Regulations*. Students should review, in particular, the policy on academic integrity that includes guidelines regarding plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. These policies can be found in the undergraduate catalog. A digital copy of the catalog is locate at the following web address:

- [http://public.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/policies.pdf](http://public.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/policies.pdf)


## Plagiarism
In an instructional setting, **plagiarism** occurs when a person presents or turns in work that includes someone else's ideas, language, or other (not common-knowledge ) material without giving appropriate credit to the source. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and may result in failing this course, and may also result in further consequences as stipulated in the [Taylor University Undergraduate Catalog](http://public.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/catalog.pdf).


## Academic Dishonesty
Academic dishonesty constitutes a serious violation of academic integrity and scholarship standards at Taylor that can result in substantial penalties, at the sole discretion of the University, including but not limited to, denial of credit in a course as well as dismissal from the University.  In short, a student violates academic integrity when he or she claims credit for any work not his or her own (words, ideas, answers, data, program codes, music, etc.) or when a student misrepresents any academic performance. Please see the [Taylor University Undergraduate Catalog](http://public.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/catalog.pdf) for a complete statement.


## Late Work
Late assignments are not accepted.


## Confidentiality
Students should use the LMS to communicate sensitive information to the professor (such as grades).

Students may be asked to (or choose to) use external information systems such as Slack, GitHub, and/or Google applications for this course. Students should not transmit sensitive information using these external communication services. Taylor University has no control over information shared on these external platforms.

Students should not communicate sensitive information over email. Email is nonsecure. If students wish to communicate sensitive information to the instructor using email, they should use public key cryptography. The instructors PGP public key can be found in public key server pools and at the following web address:

  https://cse.taylor.edu/~dstanley/48E9F1E4.asc


## Final Exam

Students must take their final examinations at the assigned hours listed on the final exam schedule.  Exceptions are made only due to serious illness or death of an immediate member of the family.  Reasons such as plane schedules, availability of flights, and rides leaving early are not acceptable exceptions. 

Students scheduled to take more than two final exams on the same day may, with written permission from the instructor, reschedule an exam(s) to maintain a maximum of two exams per day.  Students must contact the Office of the Registrar to begin the rescheduling process.  Rescheduling must be approved at least 10 days prior to the last class day of the semester.
