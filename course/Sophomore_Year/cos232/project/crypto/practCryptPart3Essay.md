# Essay for Practical Cryptography Part 3

For part 3 of this Practical cryptography assignment, I was asked to use asymmetric encryption to encrypt and send an email to Dr. Stanley. Therefore, I did indeed use asymmetric (public-key) encryption in doing this assignment. I found this part to be much more difficult than part 2 because it was much more in depth. What I mean by that is instead of simply encrypting a file and sending it, I had to first download a a free, open-source email client named thunderbird. Then I had to add on a tool called enigmail. Enigmail is basically OpenPGP's add on tool. Then I had to learn how to use the tool. In doing this, I was able to copy your public key link from the add on tool and store your key into the tool. Then I figured out how to use the tool along with sending an email, to use your public key to encrypt the email so that you could use your private key to decrypt it. The keys for the cryptosystem were your public key and your private key. The strengths with this approach is that it is much more secure than private key encryption. However, even though it's more safe and easier for more people to be able to encrypt something to the reciever, it is slower than symmetric encryption
