   BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO FEAR THE LORD, 
   WHO FIND GREAT DELIGHT IN HIS COMMANDS. 
 2 THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE MIGHTY IN THE LAND; 
   THE GENERATION OF THE UPRIGHT WILL BE BLESSED. 
 3 WEALTH AND RICHES ARE IN THEIR HOUSES, 
   AND THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER. 
 4 EVEN IN DARKNESS LIGHT DAWNS FOR THE UPRIGHT, 
   FOR THOSE WHO ARE GRACIOUS AND COMPASSIONATE AND RIGHTEOUS. 
 5 GOOD WILL COME TO THOSE WHO ARE GENEROUS AND LEND FREELY, 
   WHO CONDUCT THEIR AFFAIRS WITH JUSTICE. 
 6 SURELY THE RIGHTEOUS WILL NEVER BE SHAKEN; 
   THEY WILL BE REMEMBERED FOREVER. 
 7 THEY WILL HAVE NO FEAR OF BAD NEWS; 
   THEIR HEARTS ARE STEADFAST, TRUSTING IN THE LORD. 
 8 THEIR HEARTS ARE SECURE, THEY WILL HAVE NO FEAR; 
   IN THE END THEY WILL LOOK IN TRIUMPH ON THEIR FOES. 
 9 THEY HAVE FREELY SCATTERED THEIR GIFTS TO THE POOR, 
   THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER; 
   THEIR HORN[C] WILL BE LIFTED HIGH IN HONOR. 
10 THE WICKED WILL SEE AND BE VEXED, 
   THEY WILL GNASH THEIR TEETH AND WASTE AWAY; 
   THE LONGINGS OF THE WICKED WILL COME TO NOTHING.
