# Essay for Practical Cryptography Part 2

For this part of the assignment my task was to encrypt a file using symmetric encryption. I
began this task my searching the internet for different techniques to go about this. I 
learned that there is a command called openssl that can be used to encrypt and decrypt 
files, folders, and more using different types of encryption. For this instance I used 
symmetric encryption since that's what I was asked to use. The encryption key for the 
cryptosystem I used was "thisisabadkey". SSL stands for secure socket layer. It's a 
security protocol used to secure data with encryption between 2 computers. It works 
by making an SS certificate that digitally ties a cryptographic key to a server or domain. 
The encryption technology it uses is either 128 or 256-bit SSL technology. In this case 
I used 256 bit. The weakest part of the encryption was definitly the encryption key. When 
it comes to they type of encryption though, symettric key encryption is fast (benefit), but 
not as safe (downside) since I had to send the file as well as the encryption key.
