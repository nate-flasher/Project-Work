# Essay for Practical Cryptography Part 2

For this part of the assignment my task was to encrypt a file using symmetric encryption. I began this task my searching the internet for different techniques to go about this. I learned that there is a command called gpg that can be used to encrypt and decrypt files, folders, and more using different types of encryption. For this instance I used symmetric encryption since that's what I was asked to use. The encryption key for the cryptosystem I used was "thiskeywillwork". The encryption algorithm that gpg uses by default is called CAST5. CAST5 has a block size of 64 bits. In general the cipher works pretty well, but it definitely is not the safest or strongest one out there. For example the 128 and 256 bit ciphers are much stronger. The weakest part of the encryption was definitly the encryption key. When it comes to they type of encryption though, symettric key encryption is fast (benefit), but not as safe (downside) since I had to send the file as well as the encryption key. Also, it's unfortunate and not very secure that I need to write the key down on a piece of paper and deliver that to you in person. The paper could get lost or potentially stolen.
