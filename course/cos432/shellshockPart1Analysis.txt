Shellshock is the name of a vulnerabilty in computer systems that has been around for about 3 decades now. 
The vulnerability was discovered by Stéphane Chazelas, on September 12, 2014 where Chazelas found a bug in 
the Bash command line shell, and was given the CVE of CVE-2014-6271. A fix/patch was implemented through an
update 10 days later on September 24, 2014. By exploiting shellshock, an attacker is able to escalate their
own priviledges in the system that they otherwise would not have. This allows the attacker to then do what 
they desire with the system. The vulnerability is exploited by attackers today relatively quite often because 
of the simplicity of the attack, low cost, and small amount of knowledge needed in comparison to other 
vulnerabilities.The common weakness found from the Common Weakness Enumeration for vulnerabilities such as 
shellshock is the unintentional allowance for attackers to execute unintended, malicious commands, they should 
not have access to, directly on the operating system. The system is yet at more risk if it does not follow the
principle of least privilege, meaning the system will then not prevent the attacker from obtaining the privileges
that allow for them to inflict yet more damage with commands they wouldn't have had access to if the principle 
was in effect in the system.
